Please to change

There are three index html files
1. file /index.html. This is the landing page for my blog
2. file /blog/index.html. This is the page when click blog menu
3. file /blog/archives/index.html. This is the page storing all post titles

Under each post directory path consisting date information, there is a index.html file storing the post content.
Each of the above files have a section on "about me" and "recent post" (this should be change dynamically)


1. go to blog new a post according to the date, update the recent post above. All these can be programmed
2. write the post, copy the template from the first post
